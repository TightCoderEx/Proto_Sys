# Proto_Sys
In a technical sense, this is an operating system, insomuch as it does manage system resources, but the primary intent is to be a prototyping system, not only for X86, but AVR, ARM and PIC too. In the inaugural phase of development, these other platforms will be quite some time into the future, but should give a better overview of where I'm headed. Unlike other development environments, this is going to be exclusively oriented around low level code in each of the respective platforms. The core of the system is focused around IA32/64 and will be completely independant of Windows, Linux and OSX.
